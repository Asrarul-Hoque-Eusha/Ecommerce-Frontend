# Responsive Ecommerce Frontend

In this repository I have created a responsive frontend ecommerce website. In this website I have implemented the swithcing of mode like light to dark mode and vice versa. It has been done using useState and useEffect states of react. Also here a slider is added to show the ongoing discounts. In the menu bar there is also a Trending Products menu through which dropdown user can access the trending products.

The sections in this website are:

<ul>
<li>Search bar and Cart</li>
<li>Sliding Heroes</li>
<li>Main Body</li>
<li>About Us</li>
</ul>

</ol>
